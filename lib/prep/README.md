# Interview Prep

You never know what an interview coding exercise will entail, so reviewing a broad range of data structures and algorithms can be a good strategy.

## What's Copied?

Preparing involved attempting to write out various sorts and data structures from scratch and unit tests to ensure they do what is expected. The goal was to be able to write these out cold, and there have been a few passes at doing this over the past couple weeks. What's committed to this repo represents the final attempt to do so.

After doing some benchmarking realized my quicksort didn't perform as fast as expected, so went and studied someone else's and brought it in as "quicksortB" after modifying it not to turn the pivot and swap pieces into separate functions (not really needed).

These implementations are no doubt influenced by [Scott Barrett's _Data Structures & Algorithms_](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript/learn/lecture/24926410#overviewhttps://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript) course I took as a refresher earlier this year. In that course he challenged students to spend 30 days practicing various data structures & algorithms to help cement what he was teaching. So the self-challenge here to write out sorts and data structures is in the spirit of (and thanks to) the format of that course.
